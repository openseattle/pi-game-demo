> Connecting citizens through public gaming experiences.

## What is this

Multiple arcade machines are placed in a variety of locations in Seattle. These aren't your usual arcade machines, though. They are custom built with unique games designed specifically to be played by residents of the city. 

Players are given the chance to collaborate from a distance. Someone in Lake City solving a puzzle with someone in White Center. A player in the International District exploring a virtual world with a player in Ballard.

Popup Arcade is an opportunity to learn about your city and fellow residents through collaborative, place-based arcade games.

Imagine a co-op puzzle game that invites citizens across the city to play and connect with each other. The game would consist of puzzles that require multi-player involvement to solve. The goal is to improve community engagment across a city, and encourage citizens to work together toward a common goal. For example, the puzzles would require multiple players to solve them, and a player can request help, which would make a remote console flash in order to attract the help of a passerby.
