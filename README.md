connecting citizens through public gaming experiences

Imagine a co-op puzzle game that invites citizens across the city to play and connect with each other. The game would consist of puzzles that require multi-player involvement to solve. The goal is to improve community engagment across a city, and encourage citizens to work together toward a common goal. For example, the puzzles would require multiple players to solve them, and a player can request help, which would make a remote console flash in order to attract the help of a passerby.
